        <h3>First Project</h3>

          I had an exciting internship working as a big data engineering intern
          at Keysight Technologies during the summer of 2019. My first task was
          to build a big data analytics system to centralize data coming from
          multiple applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I designed three prototypes to inspect the scalability,
          cost-effectivity, and efficiency of each system. The product of my
          research includes a data lake, a schema detector that builds data
          catalog automatically, and SQL statements for high-efficiency
          interactions with databases.

        <h3>Second Project</h3>

        </figure>
        <p>
          I was also given more opportunities to work on several other projects
          that eventually helped to streamline sophisticated work processes and
          improved work efficiency for the department.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, I built and trained two artificial neural network models
          (Autoencoder and XGBOD) for data pattern recognition and anomaly
          detection with 97% accuracy, which ultimately replaced the time taxing
          manual testing performed by the engineers.

        I spent my time doing a co-operative education with Intel as an IoT
        software engineering intern. My responsibility focused on two parallel
        projects where the first one was to develop a contextual AI chatbot. The
        most exciting yet challenging part is the chatbot conversation flow
        design with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, which upgraded the
        scripted chatbot to an artificially intelligent chatbot.
        For my second task, I developed an interactive Python (TensorFlow and
        pandas) based analysis tool, which involves data mining and data
        modeling to provide useful intelligence to the team.

        Besides being a student or intern, I am the president and software lead
        of a NASA Robotic Mining Competition team that builds autonomous mars
        rover. In addition to overseeing a team of 37 individuals, I also lead
        the team in developing an algorithm for autonomous systems and
        maintaining version control system with GitHub. The team was barely a
        year old when I joined, and there was only a basic control system.

        I took the initiatives to research on the upgrade of communication and
        control system which results in the designing of an embedded system
        which uses Arduino Due to control the driving and mining system whereas
        Raspberry Pi for sensors data processing and communication between
        devices.
