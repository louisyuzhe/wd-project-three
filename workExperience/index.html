          <p>
            I had an exciting internship working as a big data engineering intern
            at Keysight Technologies during the summer of 2019. My first task was
            to build a big data analytics system to centralize data coming from
            multiple applications.
            I designed three prototypes to inspect the scalability,
            cost-effectivity, and efficiency of each system. The product of my
            research includes a data lake, a schema detector that builds data
            catalog automatically, and SQL statements for high-efficiency
            interactions with databases.
            I also built and trained two artificial neural network models
            (Autoencoder and XGBOD) for data pattern recognition and anomaly
            detection with 97% accuracy, which ultimately replaced the time taxing
            manual testing performed by the engineers.

            I spent my time doing a co-operative education with Intel as an IoT
            software engineering intern. My responsibility focused on two parallel
            projects where the first one was to develop a contextual AI chatbot. The
            most exciting yet challenging part is the chatbot conversation flow
            design with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, which upgraded the
            scripted chatbot to an artificially intelligent chatbot.
            For my second task, I developed an interactive Python (TensorFlow and
            pandas) based analysis tool, which involves data mining and data
            modeling to provide useful intelligence to the team.
